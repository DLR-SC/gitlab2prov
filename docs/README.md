## The GitLab2PROV Provenance Model
The GitLab2PROV provenance model comprises several submodels that address different user interactions with a GitLab project and its corresponding git repository. Some submodels have been developed without existing examples, while others are adaptations of related projects like [`git2prov`](https://github.com/IDLabResearch/Git2PROV) or [`github2prov`](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/tapp2019-paper-packer.pdf).

In total, the GitLab2PROV provenance model includes the following submodels:

1. **Git: Addition of a File**
2. **Git: Modification of a File**
3. **Git: Deletion of a File**
4. **GitLab: Commit Web Resource**
5. **GitLab: Issue Web Resource**
6. **GitLab: Merge Request Web Resource**
7. **GitLab: Release & Tag Resource**

This document provides a concise explanation for each model, including a reference table for each PROV element that defines the attributes attached to the element. 
The reference tables for qualified relations, which are relations with attached attributes, are also included.

To represent relationships/relations, this document uses the Cypher query language notation. 
The notation consists of an ASCII art-based representation of a directed relation `r` of type `R` between vertices `S` and `T`.

`(S)-[r:R]->(T)`

## Git: Addition of a File

![Addition of a File.](./svgs/git_commit_model_add.svg)

This model captures the addition of a new file to a GitLab project's git repository by a git commit.

All human actors involved in the process are included in the model. 
These actors are represented as agents in the model. 
The author represents the user that originally wrote the code contained in the commit. 
The committer represents the user that committed the code on behalf of the author. 
The committer and author can be the same person but do not have to be.

The commit and all of its parents are captured as activities. 
Each commit is informed by its parent commit. 
The commit is associated with both the author and committer as these are the actors responsible for its existence.

Two entities are created for the added file. 
The File entity represents the origin of the added file as well as the concept of its originality. 
The second entity, called FileRevision, represents the added file at the time of its addition. 
The revisions are marked as specializations of the file origin. 
Both entities are generated by the commit activity and are attributed to the author of the commit, the actor responsible for their content and creation.

Some PROV relations in this model are "qualified" relations.
In simple terms: Some PROV relations have attributes attached to them.
The following tables define the attributes attached to these relations.

## Git: Modification of a File

![Modifying a file.](./svgs/git_commit_model_mod.svg)

This model captures the modification of a file in a GitLab project's git repository by a git commit.

All human actors involved in the process are included in the model. 
These actors are represented as agents in the model. 
The author represents the user that originally wrote the code contained in the commit. 
The committer represents the user that committed the code on behalf of the author. 
The committer and author can be the same person but do not have to be.

The commit and all of its parents are captured as activities. 
Each commit is informed by its parent commit. 
The commit is associated with both the author and committer as these are the actors responsible for its existence. 
The commit uses the PreviousFileRevision to generate a new revision that accounts for the modifications included in the commit.

Three entities are created for the modified file. 
The File entity represents the origin of the file as well as the concept of its originality. 
The File entity already exists due to it being created in the 'Git: Addition of a File' model. 
The second entity, called PreviousFileRevision, represents the latest file revision of the modified file before modification. 
The third entity, called FileRevision, represents the revision of the file after the modification has been accounted for. 
The FileRevision is derived from the previous revision of the modified file and is generated by the commit activity. 
All revisions are marked as specializations of the File entity.

## Git: Deletion of a File

![Deleting a file.](./svgs/git_commit_model_del.svg)

This model documents the removal of a file from the git repository of a GitLab project through a git commit.

The model accounts for all human actors involved in the process. 
These actors are represented as agents in the model and include the author and the committer of the git commit. 
The author represents the user who originally wrote the code contained in the commit, while the committer represents the user who committed the code on behalf of the author. 
It is possible for the committer and author to be the same person.

The commit, as well as all of its parents, are captured as activities. 
Each commit builds upon the git repository that the parent commits left behind and is informed by its parent commit. 
The commit is attributed to both author and committer, as these are the actors responsible for its existence.

The model generates two entities for the deleted file. 
The File entity represents the origin of the file and the concept of its originality. 
The second entity, FileRevision, represents the revision of the file at the time of its deletion. 
The deleted revision is invalidated by the commit that removes it from the repository and is marked as a specialization of the original File entity.

## GitLab: Commit Web Resource

![GitLab Commit Model](./svgs/gitlab_commit_model.svg)

This model focuses on capturing the creation and annotation of a GitLab commit web resource, which refers to the webpage of a Git commit as displayed by GitLab.

Upon pushing a commit to the GitLab remote, GitLab automatically generates a webpage for the commit.
Users can interact with this webpage by leaving comments in the comment section and engaging in other interactions.
GitLab captures and stores some of these interactions in internal data structures.
As a result, comments written by users and other stored interactions can be retrieved through the GitLab API.
In this model, these retrievable interactions, such as comments, are considered as annotations to the web resource.

The model encompasses all human actors involved in the process of creating or annotating a GitLab commit web resource. 
This includes the author of the GitLab commit web resource, who is the user that pushed the commit to the GitLab remote, triggering the creation of the web resource. 
Additionally, it includes all users who are responsible for annotations, such as comments.

An annotator is a user who is responsible for the existence of an annotation, such as a comment, on the GitLab commit web resource. 
For instance, in the case of a comment being an annotation, the responsible annotator would be the author of that comment. 
The model accounts for all these actors, providing a comprehensive representation of the human involvement in the creation and annotation of the GitLab commit web resource.

The creation of the GitLab commit web resource is captured as an activity, which is informed by the corresponding git commit that triggered the creation. The user who pushed the commit to the GitLab remote is associated with the creation activity and referred to as the "GitLab Commit Author".

Each annotation is represented as an activity that generates a new version of the web resource by using the latest version. 
The user responsible for creating the annotation is associated with the annotation activity. 
Annotations are informed by either the preceding annotation, if any, or the creation activity, if no annotations have been recorded yet. 
This forms a chain of events, reflecting the chain of interactions between users and the GitLab commit web resource.

The GitLab commit web resource is represented by multiple entities. Firstly, an entity for the original web resource and its concept of originality called "GitLab Commit". Secondly, an entity for the version of the GitLab commit web resource at the time of its creation, referred to as "Commit Version". For each annotation, a separate entity called "Annotated Commit Version" captures the state of the commit web resource after the annotation occurred.

The creation activity generates the original web resource entity and the Commit Version entity, representing the web resource at the point of creation. Both of these entities are attributed to the GitLab Commit Author, who pushed the commit to the GitLab remote.

Each annotated commit version is generated by the corresponding annotation activity, capturing the web resource state after the annotation. 
The Annotated Commit Version entity is attributed to its annotator, who is responsible for creating the annotation. 
This way, the model captures the lineage of the GitLab commit web resource and associates it with the relevant users and activities throughout the process.

## GitLab: Issue Web Resource

![GitLab Issue Model](./svgs/gitlab_issue_model.svg)

The GitLab: Issue Web Resource model represents the creation and annotation of a GitLab issue web resource, specifically the webpage of an issue as displayed in GitLab.

The structure of the GitLab: Issue Web Resource model is similar to that of the GitLab: Commit Web Resource model.
GitLab's issue tracker can be accessed via the GitLab API just like the commit web resources.
Both models share similar concepts and ideas behind their design.

The model encompasses all human actors involved in the creation or annotation process of a GitLab issue web resource. 
These actors include the author of the GitLab issue web resource, as well as users responsible for annotations.

The issue author refers to the user who originally opened/created the issue.

An annotator is a user who is responsible for creating annotations, such as comments, labels, etc. 
For instance, in the case of a comment annotation, the author of the comment is considered the responsible annotator.

The creation of the web resource is captured as an activity, which is associated with the user who opened/created the issue, referred to as the "Issue Author" within the context of the creation activity.

Each annotation is captured as an activity that uses the latest version of the web resource to generate a new version. 
Each annotation is associated with the user responsible for creating it.

Annotations are informed by either the preceding annotation, if any, or the creation activity if no annotations have been recorded yet. 
This creates a chain of events that corresponds to the interactions between users and the GitLab issue web resource.

The issue web resource is represented by multiple entities, including one for the original web resource referred to as "Issue" which captures its concept of originality. 
Another entity is created for the version of the GitLab issue web resource at the time of its creation, called "Issue Version". 
Additionally, one entity is created per annotation to capture the issue web resource right after the annotation has occurred, known as "Annotated Issue Version".

Both the original web resource and the resource version at the point of creation are generated by the creation activity, and are attributed to the GitLab issue author.

Each annotated issue version is generated by the corresponding annotation activity, and is attributed to its annotator. 
This allows for capturing the changes in the issue web resource after each annotation activity has taken place.

## GitLab: Merge Request Web Resource

![GitLab Merge Request Model](./svgs/gitlab_merge_request_model.svg)

The GitLab: Merge Request Web Resource model represents the creation and annotation of a GitLab merge request web resource, which refers to the webpage of a merge request as displayed in GitLab.

The structure of the GitLab: Merge Request Web Resource model is similar to that of the GitLab: Commit Web Resource model.

Both models share similar concepts and ideas behind their design.

This model captures the creation and annotation of a GitLab merge request web resource, i.e. the webpage of a merge request as displayed by GitLab.

The model encompasses all human actors involved in the creation or annotation process of a GitLab merge request web resource. 
These actors include the author of the GitLab merge request web resource, as well as users responsible for annotations.

The merge request author refers to the user who originally opened/created the merge request.

An annotator is a user who is responsible for creating annotations, such as comments, labels, etc. 
For instance, in the case of a comment annotation, the author of the comment is considered the responsible annotator.

The creation of the merge request web resource is represented as an activity in the model.
The creation activity is associated with the user who opened/created the merge request, referred to as "Merge Request Author" in the context of the creation activity.

Each annotation is captured as an activity that utilizes the latest version of the web resource to generate a new version.
Each annotation is associated with the user who is responsible for creating it.

Annotations are informed by either the preceding annotation or, if no annotations have been recorded yet, the creation activity itself.
These annotations collectively form a chain of events that corresponds to the interactions between users and the GitLab merge request web resource.

The GitLab merge request web resource is represented by multiple entities in the model.
One entity represents the original web resource and its concept of originality, referred to as "Merge Request".
A second entity represents the version of the GitLab merge request web resource at the time of its creation, called "Merge Request Version".

For each annotation, a separate entity is created to capture the merge request web resource right after the annotation occurred, called "Annotated Merge Request Version".

The original web resource and the resource version at the point of creation are generated by the creation activity, and are attributed to the GitLab merge request author.

Each annotated merge request version is generated by the corresponding annotation activity, and is attributed to its annotator.

## GitLab: Release & Tag Resource

![GitLab Release & Tag Model](./svgs/gitlab_release_tag_model.svg)

This model captures the creation of gitlab releases and tags.

The model includes all human actors involved in the process of the creation of a release of tag.
In this case the actors are the author of the release, the author of the tag and the author of the git commit that pushed the tag.

The creation of a release is captured as an activity called "Release Creation".
The creation of a tag  is captured as an activity called "Tag Creation".
The creation of a commit is captured as an activity called "Commit Creation".
The release creation is associated with the author responsible for the release.
The tag creation is associated with the author responsible for the tag.
The commit creation is associated with the git commit author.

An entity is created for each release, tag and commit.
The tag and release entities are considered to be a `prov:Collection`.
Each gitlab release includes multiple asset files aswell as a release evidence file.
Each such file is captured in an entity.
The release is generated by the release creation activity.
The tag is generated by the tag creation activity.
The commit is generated by the commit creation activity.

## Annotations

GitLab allows annotations or comments to be displayed on the webpages of respective resources. 
For example, if a resource (such as an issue or merge request) is mentioned in the comment thread of another resource, GitLab displays that mention in the comment section of the mentioned target. 
This allows for discussions, references, and annotations to be visible and accessible within the context of the related resources, making it easier for users to collaborate and track discussions on GitLab webpages.

![comment thread](issue-thread.png)

Annotations can be parsed from various sources provided by the official GitLab API. 
However, there is no dedicated endpoint for retrieving all annotations of interest, particularly those that connect resources, which can be challenging to obtain. 
Here is a brief summary of the data that needs to be retrieved, how to parse it, and the workarounds that have been deployed to achieve annotation parsing.

To retrieve label events, we use the official API endpoint and parse the relevant annotations such as "add_label" and "remove_label". 
Emoji awards can be retrieved from the appropriate API endpoint. 
For other annotations such as mentions, time tracking stats, due dates, TODO's, etc., we parse them from system notes that GitLab uses to display annotations in their web interface.

System notes contain a string that describes the annotation they represent. 
We classify the annotation based on the string using regular expressions, and use named groups in the regular expressions to extract relevant information from the annotation strings. 
These extracted information are later added to PROV element attributes.

Noted, this approach may not be optimal as older GitLab versions may employ different string notations for the same annotation, sometimes differing by only a few characters or even having completely different strings for the same annotation. 
Additionally, there may be issues when parsing imported projects, where relevant annotations may not be recorded as system notes but rather as normal notes. 
This is not currently accounted for in the current note parsing approach.

Here is a list of annotations that we are currently able to parse, along with a short description of what the annotation is and the API resource from which we parse that annotation.
